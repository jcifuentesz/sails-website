<h1 id="associations">Associations</h1>
<p>With Sails and Waterline, you can associate models across multiple data stores. This means that even if your users live in <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and their photos live in <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, you can interact with the data as if they lived together in the same database. You can also have associations that span different <a href="http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/sails.config/sails.config.connections.html" target="_blank">connections</a> (i.e. datastores/databases) using the same adapter.  This comes in handy if, for example, your app needs to access/update legacy recipe data stored in a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> database in your company&apos;s data center, but also store/retrieve ingredient data from a brand new MySQL database in the cloud.</p>
